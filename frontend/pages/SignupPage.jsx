 * TO DO:
 * 
 * Sign-Up Feature: currently have a separate `/signup` route with a SignupPage component.
 * If we decide later to combine the sign-up functionality with the LoginPage, 
 * here are the steps to update the code:
 * 
 * 1. Remove the the SignupPage component.
 * 2. Update this `main.jsx` file to remove the `/signup` path accordingly.
